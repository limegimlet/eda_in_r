# What is Vinho Verde?

The data set, from 2008, is comprised of white wines known as *Vinho Verde* (green wine). *Vinho Verde* (VV) refers to the Minho region of northern Portugal; it is not a type of grape. This region is known for being cooler and wetter than the rest of the country in the winter, although it does get hot in the summer.

VV wines have traditionally been known for being light, crisp and low in alchohol, and were meant to be drunk young (when they're "green"). Lately, however, VV's reputation of being a cheap & cheerful wine has begun to change.

Within this region, there are nine sub-regions.

![vvmap](images/vinhoverdemap.jpg)

As you can see from the map, the topgraphy of the VV region is varied, as well as for several of its subregions. Vinho verde wines can come from the Atlantic coast, the mountains, or inland plains. Soils vary, as do the type of grapes grown.

## Data description

   1 - fixed acidity: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)

   2 - volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste

   3 - citric acid: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines

   4 - residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet

   5 - chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine

   6 - free sulfur dioxide: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine

   7 - total sulfur dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine

   8 - density: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content

   9 - pH: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale

   10 - sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant

   11 - alcohol: the percent alcohol content of the wine

   Output variable (based on sensory data): 
   12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

## Size & structure

How large is this data set?

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}

dim(whites)

```

What are the variable names?

```{r get var names}

orig_vars <-  names(whites)
orig_vars

```

Let's see the underlying structure of the data.

```{r}

str(whites)

```

The data is numeric except for the X variable, which is an integer identifying the wing 

Alas, none of the categorical information mentioned above, such as soil type, grape variety, or subregion, is included in this data set.

## Data wrangling

### Convert `quality` to categorical

Since we need at least one categorical variable for this dataset, let's convert `quality`.

```{r, create category var}

whites$quality <-factor(whites$quality)
levels(whites$quality)

```

```{r df summary}

summary(whites)

```

There are no NA values. Only `citric.acid` has zero values. The scale of values varies from the 100s for `total.sulfur.dioxide` to 1000th decimal place for `chlorides`.

### Reshape df to long format

Now I'd like to look at distributions for all the variables, but first need to convert the df to long format.




```{r convert_to_long}


whites.tidy <- whites %>% 
  gather(-X, -quality,
         key = 'component', value = 'value', 
         na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  group_by(quality) %>% 
  arrange(quality)

whites.tidy <- data.frame(whites.tidy)
str(whites.tidy)

```

View the long-format df:

```{r view_whites_tidy}

head(whites.tidy)

```

Ok, now we're ready to plot histograms.

# Univariate plots

## Global overviews

```{r ggplot hist function}

my_hist <- function(data = whites, x, bw = NULL) {
  ggplot(data = data, aes_string(x)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = bw)
}  

```


```{r plot_hists}

# set variables used by plot function
data = whites.tidy
x = "value"

# create histogram
p <- my_hist(data, x)

# add facet layer
fw <- facet_wrap(~component, scales = 'free_x')

p + fw

```

Aside from `pH`, most variables have a moderate positive skew. `residual.sugar` has a pronounced positive skew. `alcohol` has a strangely flat shape.

What will a log-transform yield?

```{r log_transform}

p + fw + 
  scale_x_log10()

```

Log10 transform of `residual.sugar` is bimodal. Perhaps there are two distinct wine populations in the  dataset? `alcohol` still is strangely flat.

Variables improved by log10 transformation:
* `chlorides`
* `fixed.acidity`
* `residual.sugar`
* `sulphates`
* `volatile.acidity`

Let's get a better look at the outliers by plotting boxplots.

```{r boxplot function}

my_box <- function(data, x = 1, y, alpha = 0.1) {
  ggplot(data = data, aes_string(x, y)) +
    geom_boxplot(alpha = alpha)
}  

```

```{r}

data = whites.tidy
x='component'
y='value'

p <- my_box(data, x, y)

# update fw var to free y-axis!
fw <- facet_wrap(~component, scales = 'free')

p + fw


```

The only variable without positive outliers is `alcohol`. `chlorides` and `citric.acid` seem to have a high number of positive outliers. The `density` and `residual.sugar` outliers look similar.

Are any of the outliers occuring for the same row? We can check if the row for the max value is the same for more than one variable.

```{r max_vals}

# Do these extreme outliers belong to the same row?

colMaxIdx <- function(data) sapply(data, which.max)

whites.num <- unlist(lapply(whites, is.numeric))

max.rows <- colMaxIdx(whites[whites.num])

sort(max.rows)

```

Yes! `residual.sugar` & `density` share the same max row, as do `free.sulfur.dioxide` & `total.sulfur.dioxide`.


## `fixed.acidity`

> In wine tasting, the term “acidity” refers to the fresh, tart and sour attributes of the wine which are evaluated in relation to how well the acidity balances out the sweetness and bitter components of the wine such as tannins. Three primary acids are found in wine grapes: tartaric, malic and citric acids. — http://winemaking.jackkeller.net/acid.asp

`fixed.acidity` in our data set only refers to tartaric acid, the most predominant acid in wine. It helps stabilize a wine's chemical make-up and its colour. It also contributes to taste. 

It is measured in g/dm^3, which is a more scientific notation for g/l. Multiply this value by 0.1 to calculate the % by volume.

How to intrepret fixed acidity values: 

* .4% (4g/l) is considered flat
* 1% (10g/l) FA is considered too tart to be drinkable.
* Most table wine is between 0.6 to 0.7%.

```{r fixed.acidity summary}

summary(whites$fixed.acidity)

x = 'fixed.acidity'
data = whites

p <- my_hist(data, x)

p + scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(3,14,1)) 

```

`fixed.acidity` has a very slight positive skew but it is hard to see clearly on this plot. There seems to be some negative outliers too.

Let's try a boxplot instead that also shows the underlying points.

```{r fixed.acidity boxplot with points}

ggplot(aes(x="1", y=fixed.acidity), data=whites) +
  geom_boxplot(width=0.6, alpha=0.2)
  
```

Indeed, most values do fall between 6 and 7.5 g/l. But there is a cluster of low, 'flat-tasting' wines between 4 & 5, and a bigger cluster at the tart end of the scale, between 8.5 & 9.


##`volatile.acidity`

Volatile acidity (VA) is primarily a measure of the presence of acetic acid. While a small amount is a natural by-product of fermentation, exposure to oxygen converts alcohol to acetic acid, which is known as oxidization. Too much acetic acid creates a vinegar taste in wine. 

A VA of 0.03-0.06% is produced during fermentation and is considered a normal level. 
(source: http://www.wineperspective.com/the_acidity_of_wine.htm)

Since `volatile.acidity` is in g/l, multiply the values by 0.1 to calculate the %.

```{r volatile.acidity summary}

summary(whites$volatile.acidity)

qplot(volatile.acidity, data=whites,
      binwidth=.02)

```

The distribution is negatively skewed. Let's transform the x-axis to have a better look at the long tail values.

```{r volatile.acidity log10}

qplot(volatile.acidity, data=whites, 
      binwidth=.05) + 
      scale_x_log10(breaks=seq(0,1,.1))

```

While most of values are less than 0.03%, there are quite a few outliers above 0.06%, with the highest reaching `r max(whites$volatile.acidity) * 0.1`%.

```{r}
ggplot(whites, aes(x=1, y=volatile.acidity)) + 
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.2)
```

#### Transform `volatile.acidity`

```{r volatile.acidity log10 xform}

whites <- whites %>% 
  mutate(log10.v.acidity = log10(volatile.acidity)) %>% 
  select(-volatile.acidity)

```



##`citric.acid`


```{r citric.acid summary}

str(whites)

summary(whites$citric.acid)

qplot(data=whites, citric.acid,
      binwidth=.02)

```

The distribution for `citric acid` is normal with fewer positive outliers compared to the previous phytochemicals examined.

After reducing the binwidth I noticed some strange spikes at 0, 0.5 and 0.75g/l, and even at 1g/l.

Here is a possible explanation: 

> In the European Union, use of citric acid for acidification is prohibited, but limited use of citric acid is permitted for removing excess iron and copper from the wine if potassium ferrocyanide is not available. — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acids_in_wine#Citric_acid

And this is from a 2003 export agreement between Canada and the EU:

> 15. addition of citric acid for wine stabilisation purposes, provided that the final content in the treated wine does not exceed 1 g/l, — http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52003PC0377 (section B, item 15)

## `sulphates`

Sulphates stabilize wine, and are more important for white wines than reds, which also have tannins to help with stabilization.

Maximum levels of sulfur dioxide that a wine can contain 210 mg/l for white wine, 260 mg/l for sweet wines (> 5g/l residual sugar). [source](http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/resources/000/264/146/euwineregs.pdf)

```{r}

qplot(sulphates, data=whites, binwidth = 0.025)

```

This also looks to be bi-modal with modes around 0.45 and 0.5, and a positive skew.

```{r}

summary(whites$sulphates)

```


##`pH`

This is a test of how strong the acidity is. Wines typically have a pH between 2.9 and 3.9.
The lower the pH, the more acidic (instead of basic) the wine.

```{r pH summary}

summary(whites$pH)

qplot(pH, data=whites, binwidth=.05) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(2,4.5,.25)) 

```

In this dataset `pH`'s distribution is a near-perfect bell curve. 

The entire range of `pH` values is from `r min(whites$pH)` to `r max(whites$pH)`, so veers slightly more than usual to the acidic end of the wine pH spectrum.

##`chlorides`

> In most wines, the chloride concentration is below 50mg/l, expressed in sodium chloride. It may exceed 1g/l in wine made from grapes grown by the sea.

> Sodium chloride is sometimes added during fining, especially when egg whites are used.- [Handbook of Enology, The Chemistry of Wine: Stabilization and Treatments](https://books.google.fr/books?id=a03C-aFy2jsC&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=adding+sodium+chloride+to+wine&source=bl&ots=pAoGDmfuTl&sig=AqMfDCikyNKXX__SWzFgWuvam5o&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjfy4rx9KHLAhUGcHIKHZxSATcQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&q=adding%20sodium%20chloride%20to%20wine&f=false)


```{r chlorides hist}

qplot(chlorides, data=whites, binwidth=.005)

```

Positive skew with a very long tail. 

```{r chlorides_summary}

summary(whites$chlorides)

```


```{r chloride log10}

#look at that long tail
qplot(chlorides, data=whites, binwidth=.05) +
  scale_x_log10()

```

This looks more balanced. Let's confirm with a boxplot.

```{r chlorides boxplot}

ggplot(aes(x="1", y=chlorides), data=whites) +
  geom_boxplot(width=0.5, alpha=0.2) + 
  scale_y_log10()

```

Transforming the x-axis to log10 shows that choloride values are discrete that beome continuous as chloride levels reach 0.3 g/l (300 mg/l) and a bit beyond. This is higher than normal, but still a far cry from 1 g/l.

I wonder if the region's notorious rain and mist in wintertime results in higher than usual salinity in the soil of coastal subregions, which is then absorbed by the grapes. 

#### Transform `chlorides`

```{r log_xform_chlorides}

whites <- whites %>% 
  mutate(log10.chlorides = log10(chlorides)) %>% 
  select(-chlorides)

  
```

## `free.sulfur.dioxide`

```{r hist free.sulfur.dioxide}

data = whites
x='free.sulfur.dioxide'
bw = 5
p <- my_hist(data, x, bw)
p


```


## `total.sulfur.dioxide`

```{r}

p %+% aes(total.sulfur.dioxide)

```

Normal distribution with what looks like only a couple of outliers.

```{r}

data = whites
x = 1
y = 'total.sulfur.dioxide'
#alpha = .1


p <- my_box(data, x, y)
p

```



##`residual.sugar`

```{r residual.sugar_hist}

#data = whites
x = 'residual.sugar'
bw = 1
p = my_hist(data, x, bw)
p
```



```{r residual.sugar_hist_zoom}

# zoom in
p +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,25), breaks=seq(0,25,5))

```

```{r residual.sugar_summary}

summary(whites$residual.sugar)

```

Hmmm. Let's look at this using a log10 x-axis.

```{r residual.sugar log10 plots}

bw = .1
p <- ggplot(data, aes(x=log10(residual.sugar), y =..density..)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = bw) +
  geom_density(color='blue')

p

```


There are a few extreme outliers above 20. The distribution now looks like a camel: it has two humps. 

Are there two populations within this data set?

```{r residual.sugar_violin_plot}

ggplot(aes(x=1, y=log10(residual.sugar)), data=whites) +
  geom_violin(color='blue') + 
  geom_jitter(alpha=0.2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, color='blue')
```

Looks like there's a split at 0.5 of log10 of `residual.sugar`.

#### Transform: `residual.sugar`

Let's create two new variables: 

* a log10 transform of residual.sugar, and 
* a categorical variable for sweetness.

```{r create_new_vars_residual.sugar}

whites <- whites %>% 
 mutate(log10.r.sugar = log10(residual.sugar),
        r.sugar.level = ifelse(log10.r.sugar > .5, 'high sugar', 'low sugar'))
```

## density

Density is what makes wine feel full-bodied. Since VV wines are known for their lightness, I'd expect this dataset to be lower-density than your typical white wine dataset (if I had any to compare it to).

Higher density in wine is usually a result of higher sugar or higher alcohol content. 

```{r density_hist}

summary(whites$density)

x = "density"
bw =.001 
my_hist(data, x, bw)


```

```{r density_boxplot}

ggplot(aes(x="1", y=density), data=whites) +
  geom_boxplot(width=0.5, alpha=0.2)

```

There are only 2 extreme outliers in that long tail. What does the distribution look like if we zoom in?

```{r density_zoom_hist}

qplot(density, data=whites, binwidth=.0005) + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0.985,1.005))

```


Not suprisingly, since it's related to sugar & alcohol, `density`'s distribution is a bit lumpy, but less than for `residual.sugar` and `alcohol`. It also has two extreme positive outliers, just like `residual.sugar`.

```{r}

qplot(density, data=whites, binwidth=.0002) + 
  scale_x_log10(limits=c(0.985,1.005)) +
  geom_density(colour='blue')

```

This doesn't help much.

##quality

Let's see how many of each quality level?

```{r quality_count}

summary((whites$quality))
qplot(quality, data=whites)


```

A normal distribution: lots of mediocre wines with few low-quality and even fewer high-quality wines. 

## `alcohol`

```{r alcohol dist}

p = qplot(alcohol, data=whites, binwidth=.2)
p

```

```{r alcohol summary}

summary(whites$alcohol)

```

Alcohol content ranges from `r min(whites$alcohol)` to `r max(whites$alcohol)`% by volume. 
The distribution looks unusual, not just bimodal but multimodal. 
The main mode is at 9.5%, but there are smaller, 'local' modes at 10.5% and 12% as well. 

**Dip at 11.5%** 

Regardless of binwidth, there was a clear dip at 11.5%. Why?

This could be due to labelling rules:

* ‘generic’ Vinho Verde must lie between 8% and 11.5% alcohol by volume (ABV)
* wine from one of the one of the nine sub-regions, which specialise in particular grape varieties, the range extends from 9% to 14% ABV
* Vinho Verde made from the single varietal Alvarinho can be between 11.5% and 14% ABV

[Reference](https://www.alcoholprofessor.com/blog/2014/04/23/vinho-verde-a-splash-of-summer-vinous-joy/)

**Are alcohol values continuous or discrete?** 

```{r alcohol bar chart, echo=TRUE}

ggplot(aes(alcohol), data=whites) +
  geom_bar() + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(8,14.5,.5))

```


Alcohol content % is usually listed to the 10th of a percentage point. Round numbers, and .5 are more common than others.

#### Transform `alcohol`

It would be worthwhile to create some category variables based on alcohol content to see if quality correlations differ for different wine classifications.


```{r label_alchol_ranges}

whites <- whites %>% 
  mutate(alc.range = ifelse(alcohol > 11.5, "high alcohol", "low alcohol"))

```

How many wines are there in each category?

```{r plot alc.range}

p = qplot(alc.range, data=whites, stat = 'count')
p


```

There are nearly four times as many low-alcohol wines as high-alcohol ones.

# Univariate analysis

##What is the structure of your dataset?

There are `r nrow(whites)` rows, and `r dim(whites)[2]` variables.
All variables are numeric. In order to have at least one categorical variable, I converted `quality` to a factor with 7 levels.

Most wine is of average quality, a 5 or a 6. The mean `quality` score is `r mean(as.integer(whites$quality)) + 2`.

`alcohol`ranges from `r min(whites$alcohol)` to `r max(whites$alcohol)`%. The most common alcohol content is 9.5%, but the median is `r median(whites$alcohol)`, very close to the mean is `r mean(whites$alcohol)`.

Wine with a residual sugar content greater than 45 is considered sweet. Only one wine in the dataset would therefore be considered sweet. It had the maximum value of `r max(whites$residual.sugar)`g. Most wines are far below this. Average `residual.sugar` content is `r mean(whites$residual.sugar)`g, while the median is a considerably lower `r median(whites$residual.sugar)`g.


##What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?

The features I'm most interested are the characteristics most easily perceived by judges:

* alcohol
* residual.sugar

The main feature I'm interested in is `alcohol`. The VV wine's alcohol content determines how specific a region can be used on its label. Generally, the more narrower the region, the higher the price.

The main question I have around alcohol is whether quality correlates to specificity of region? In other words, do generic Vinho Verde tend to score lower than the higher subsets of wine?

The other key feature is `residual.sugar`. It plays a major part in flavour and density. Lower values could indicate secondary fermentation, which could either mean a wine that is pleasantly fizzy, or one that is more round and buttery instead of sharper and acidic. 


##What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?

These features:

* chlorides, because numerous articles about the wine referred to a refreshingly salty-sweet taste.
* total.sulfur.dioxide, because it has a r

Also, the features described in the section below will help identify different subsets for which quality correlates differently.

##Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?

Yes, I created categorical variables to: 

* label wines by alcohol range
* label wines by sweetness

```{r new_features}

whites.new = names(whites)[c(-1:-13)]
whites.new

```


##Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?

Yes, several variables had a strong positive skew. To get a more normal distribution, I log10 transformed the following:

  * `chlorides`
  * `fixed.acidity`
  * `residual.sugar`
  * `sulphates`
  * `volatile.acidity`

# Bivariate Plots Section

## Correlations

whites.cor <- whites %>%
  select(-X) %>% 
  mutate(quality = as.integer(quality)) %>%

```


```{r prep for ggpairs, echo=TRUE}

# for reproducibility

# create a sample so it doesn't take forever
whites.samp <- whites %>% 
  select (-c(X, pH, citric.acid, residual.sugar, free.sulfur.dioxide, sulphates, fixed.acidity)) %>% 
  sample_n(size=1000)




```

```{r verify names}

names(whites.samp)

```

## Pairplot


```{r ggpairs}

pm <- ggpairs(
  whites.samp,
  axisLabels = 'show',
  lower = list(
          continuous = wrap("smooth", alpha=0.2, shape = I('.'), alpha = 0.1),
          combo = wrap("box", outlier.shape = I('.'))
        )
)

pm + theme_minimal()
```

## `quality` counts by...

### `r.sugar.level`

```{r}

table(whites$r.sugar.level)

```



```{r}

d = ggplot(aes(quality), data =whites)

d + 
  geom_bar(aes()) +
  facet_wrap(~r.sugar.level)

```

There seem to be a higher proportion of high-scoring wines in the low-residual.sugar group.


```{r}

with(whites, by(quality, r.sugar.level, summary))

```


### `alcohol.range`

```{r}

table(whites$alc.range)

```


```{r}

d + 
  geom_bar(aes()) +
  facet_wrap(~alc.range)

```


* higher alcohol == greater % of high-scoring wines
* Within higher alcohol group, wines with high residual.sugar have bigger proportion of high-scores.
* For lower alcohol group, it's the reverse!


## `quality` vs...

### `alcohol`

```{r alcohol_vs_quality}

d <- ggplot(aes(alcohol, fill=quality), data=whites)
dnsty <- geom_density(alpha=0.2)

d + dnsty

```

Consistent with what was observed above: higher alcohol, higher quality.


### `log10.r.sugar` 

```{r}

d %+% aes(x = log10.r.sugar) + dnsty

```

It isn't as clear-cut as for alcohol. Here we see bimodal distribtuions at all quality levels. Level 8 seems to have 3 in fact.

In general,the most high quality wines is at the lower-end of `log10.r.sugar`.

### `density`


```{r}

d %+% aes(x = density, fill=quality) + dnsty

```


```{r}

d %+% aes(x = density, fill=quality) +
  dnsty + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0.985, 1.005))

```

This is virtually a mirror image of the `alchohol` plot, which isn't surprising since there's a strong negative correlation between the two. Higher alcohol wines tend to be better quality, which means they're less dense. 

So my feeling is density simply echoes alcohol.

### `log10.chlorides`

```{r quality_vs_log10.chlorides}

d %+% aes(x=log10.chlorides) + 
  dnsty

```

`Chlorides` seem to have the most linear relationship with `quality`.

```{r}

violin <- geom_violin(alpha = 0.2, draw_quantiles = .5)
jitter <- geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1)

d %+% aes(x=quality, y=log10.chlorides) +
  violin
```

From quality level 5 (maybe 4 too), `log10.chlorides` has a negative correlation with quality that is especially pronounced for top-end wines.

```{r}

with(whites, by(log10.chlorides, quality, median))

```



### `total.sulfur.dioxide`

```{r}

d %+% aes(total.sulfur.dioxide) + 
  dnsty

```

```{r}

d %+% aes(quality, total.sulfur.dioxide) + violin
                 
```

Generally there's a negative correlation with `quality`, but level 4 bucks the trend. But this relationship seems weaker for higher quality wines.

Let's confirm by comparing medians.

```{r compare_summary_total.sulfur.dioxide}

with(whites, by(total.sulfur.dioxide,quality, median))

```


### `log10.v.acidity`

```{r}


d <- ggplot(aes(log10.v.acidity, fill=quality), data = whites)
d + dnsty

```

## `alcohol` vs..

### `log10.r.sugar`

```{r alcohol_log10.r.sugar}

d <- ggplot(aes(alcohol, log10.r.sugar), data = whites)

d + geom_point(alpha = 0.2)

```

There are two clusters: 

* a higher-rs group that has a clear negative correlation between sugar & alcohol
* a lower-rs group for which the correlation is less apparent. 

Let's add some trend lines to these two clusters.

```{r show_converging_trends}

ss.rs = stat_smooth(aes(color = r.sugar.level), method = 'lm')
d + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) + 
  ss.rs

```


There's an inverse relationship between residual.sugar and alcohol but the direction changes depending if we're looking at low or high-sugar wines.



### `log10.chlorides`

```{r}

d <- ggplot(aes(alcohol, log10.chlorides), data = whites)

d + geom_hex()

```

This relationship by contrast looks linear for the entire dataset.

Let's confirm.

```{r single trendline}

ss =  stat_smooth(method = 'lm')
d + geom_hex() + ss
 

```


### `total.sulfur.dioxide`

```{r}

d <- d %+% aes(alcohol, total.sulfur.dioxide) 
d + geom_hex() + ss

```


Both `chlorides` & `total.sulfur.dioxide` decrease as alcohol increases.



### `log10.v.acidity`

```{r}

d <- d %+% aes(y = log10.v.acidity)
d + geom_hex() + ss

```


``volatile.acidity` doesn't have as strong as relationship with `alcohol`.

## `log10.r.sugar` vs..

### `log10.chlorides`

```{r residual.sugar_vs_log10.chlorides}

d <- d %+% aes(x = log10.r.sugar, y = log10.chlorides)

d + geom_hex() + ss

```

Definitely clustered, but the level of chlorides seems to stay relatively constant.



### `total.sulfur.dioxide`

```{r log10.r.sugar_vs_`total.sulfur.dioxide`}

d <- d %+% aes(y = total.sulfur.dioxide) 
d + geom_hex() + ss

```



### `log10.v.acidity`


```{r}

d <- d %+% aes(y = log10.v.acidity)
d + geom_hex() + ss

```



## `log10.chlorides` vs...

### `total.sulfur.dioxide`

```{r log10.chlorides_vs_total.sulfur.dioxide}

d <-  d %+% aes(log10.chlorides, total.sulfur.dioxide)

d + geom_hex() + ss


```

This just reinforces what we saw earlier. Both of these variables have negative correlations with `alcohol` and `quality`, so it's not surprising they have a positive relationship with each other.


### `log10.v.acidity`

```{r}

d <-  d %+% aes(y = log10.v.acidity)

d + geom_hex() + ss

```

There's a slight positive correlation, but there's also a lot of noise.


## `total.sulfur.dioxide` vs 


### `log10.v.acidity`

```{r}

d <-  ggplot(aes(total.sulfur.dioxide, log10.v.acidity), data = whites)

d + geom_hex() + ss

```

# Bivariate Analysis


### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the \
investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in \
the dataset?

* Quality increases with alcohol, but decrease with chlorides, residual.sugar and total.sulfur.dioxide

* At all alcohol levels, there seems to be two subgroups, a lower residual.sugar group (log10.r.sugar < 0.5) and a higher one. The subgroups have divergent relationships with alcohol:

  * For the low-sugar group, as alcohol increase, so does residual.sugar 
  * It's the opposite for the high-sugar group.
 


### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features \
(not the main feature(s) of interest)?

Yes, there's a strong positive relatioship between chlorides and total.sulfur.dioxide.

### What was the strongest relationship you found?

It was alcohol and density. According to the ggpairs plot, they have a -.79 correlation. 

# Multivariate Plots Section

## `log10.r.sugar` vs `alcohol`



```{r echo=FALSE, Multivariate_Plots}

d = ggplot(aes(alcohol, log10.r.sugar), data =whites)
ss = stat_smooth( aes(color = quality), method = 'lm', se=FALSE)
fw = facet_wrap(~r.sugar.level, ncol = 1, scales='free_y')

d + 
  geom_point(aes(colour=quality), alpha = 0.5) + 
  ss +
  fw
  

```

Convergence!

## total.sulfur.dioxide by log10.chlorides

```{r}

d = ggplot(aes(total.sulfur.dioxide, log10.chlorides), data =whites)
d + 
  geom_point(aes(color=quality), alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~quality, ncol = 1, scales='free_y')

```

Interesting: as quality improves, the _range_ for `total.sulfur.dioxide` & `log10.chlorides` becomes much narrower.

Does this hold true when we facet this by sugar?

```{r facet_by_res.sugar}

d = ggplot(aes(total.sulfur.dioxide, log10.chlorides), data =whites)
d + 
  geom_point(aes(colour=quality), alpha = 0.5) + 
  facet_grid(quality ~ r.sugar.level, scales='free_y')

```

Yes, particularly for low residual sugar wines.

Let's look at this as a 2d density plot

```{r facet_by_residual.sugar}

d = ggplot(aes(total.sulfur.dioxide, log10.chlorides), data =whites)
fw = facet_wrap(~r.sugar.level, ncol=1, scales='free_y')
p <-  d + 
  geom_density_2d(aes(colour=quality))
  

p 

```

Let's zoom in.

```{r}

cc = coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,225), ylim = c(-1.8,-.9))
p + fw + cc

```

```{r}

fg = facet_grid(quality~r.sugar.level, scales='free_y')

p + fg + cc

```


Yes for the low-sugar wines: for each step up the `quality` ladder, the minimum `total.sulfur.dioxide` increases & while the maximum decreases.

For high-sugar wines, the notion of an 'ideal range' of `total.sulfur.dioxide` in top-quality wines still holds true, but not as clearly-defined.

The 'ideal range' for `log10.chlorides` is more difficult to see here.

```{r}

d <- ggplot(aes(quality, log10.chlorides), data = whites)

d + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = quality), alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~r.sugar.level)

```

There's a general downward trend (especially for high-residual sugar wines) up until level 8, and then it drops markedly for level 9.


```{r}

d %+% aes(quality, total.sulfur.dioxide) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = quality), alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~r.sugar.level)

```

There's a relationship between `quality` & `total.sulfur.dioxide` for high-residual sugar wines. For the low-sugar wines, 

The _direction_ of the relationship, however, depends on whether the wine is high- or low-alcohol.


# Multivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the \
investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of \
looking at your feature(s) of interest?

Yes, `log10.chlorides` decreased as quality increased, particularly from level 8 to 9. Moreover, the ranges for `log10.chlorides` & `total.sulfur.dioxide` both narrowed with each step up in `quality`. When plotted on a 2d density plot, the level 9 is a smaller cluster of density rings, with a much smaller radius, and than lie considerably lower than those for the other levels. 

### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?

There was an even more complex interplay between `alcohol` and `log10.r.sugar`. The relationship depended on whether we were looking at the high sugar group (`log10.r.sugar` > 0.5) or the low one. 

* For the high-sugar group, `log10.r.sugar` would decrease as `alcohol` (and `quality`) increased.
* The reverse was true for the low-sugar group. 
* In both groups, the trendline for level 9 wines were also the steepest.
* Quality improvements for both groups were converging towards a 'sweet-spot' (pardon the pun) of 13% `alcohol`, and 0.4-0.8 `log10.r.sugar`.

# Final Plots and Summary


### Plot One
```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_One}

library(RColorBrewer)

bw = .1
p <- ggplot(data, aes(x=log10(residual.sugar), y =..density..)) +
  #geom_histogram(binwidth = bw) +
  geom_density(aes(fill=quality), alpha = 0.2)


mytheme <- theme(
  panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
  panel.grid.major = element_blank()
  )

p + 
  mytheme + 
  ggtitle("Log10 of residual.sugar is clearly bi-modal") +
  xlab('Log10 Residual Sugar (g/l)')



```

### Description One

The title says it all for me. The original histogram for residual.sugar was so lumpen it was disheartening. Simply applying a log10 transform immediately showed there were 2 populations within this dataset when it came to residual sugar, then mapping color to quality reaffirmed that: all quality levels are bimodal too.

The divergent, transluscent color layers also shows that as quality increases, the range for `log10.r.sugar` narrows - the yellow and orange tones can be seen on either side, but blues and purples dominate the center.

Lastly, it very clearly shows that by far most high-quality wines have relatively low `residual.sugar`.



### Plot Two

```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_Two}


d = ggplot(whites, aes(x=quality, y = log10.chlorides))

boxplot = d + geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, aes_string(colour="quality", fill="quality")) + 
  stat_summary(geom = "crossbar", 
               width=0.65, fatten=0, color="white", 
               fun.data = function(x){ 
                  return(c(y=median(x), ymin=median(x), ymax=median(x))) 
                })

mytheme <- theme(
  #panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
  panel.grid.major = element_blank()
  )

boxplot + 
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-1.7,-1.1)) +
  ggtitle("As quality increases, log10.chlorides decrease dramatically") + 
  xlab("Quality") + 
  ylab("Log10 Chlorides (g/l)")

```



### Description Two

There wasn't a lot of linear relationships in this dataset. This shouldn't be a surprise: wine, like anything gustatory, is about balancing contrasts flavours and textures.

Nonetheless, we can see that starting at the 'mediocre' (5) level, wine quality improves as chlorides decrease. The boxes do a great job of highlighting the enormous jump from quality level 8 to 9.


### Plot Three


```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_Three}

d = ggplot(aes(total.sulfur.dioxide, log10.chlorides), data =whites)
fw = facet_wrap(~r.sugar.level, ncol=1, scales='free_y')
p <-  d + 
  geom_density_2d(aes(colour=quality))
  

p + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "YlGnBu") +
  #fw +
  theme_dark()  + 
  ggtitle("The best wines have the smallest range of chlorides & sulfur dioxide", 
          subtitle="And much lower chloride values") +
  xlab("Total Sulfur Dioxide (mg/l)") + 
  ylab("Log10 Chlorides (g/l)")


  

```


### Description Three

Throughout this project I was haunted by the fact that I was supposed to discover relationships between a whole bunch of numerical variables and quality, yet I doubted there would be many linear relationships for something that involves taste. Instead, I looked for clusters of combinations but they were more elusive than I expected.

But when I was looking at the ggpairs plot and saw the patterns of the boxplots for these two variables, it gave me hope. Sure enough when I put them on a scatterplot and then facet-wrapped by quality I could see the range of values narrow steadily as the quality improved.

# Reflection

## Challenges

* The lack of categorical values in the original dataset, aside from `quality`
* The noiseness of the data as I suspect there are several subgroups within, all having different correlations with `quality`. The strongest correlation with `quality` in the original data was alcohol, at .44. So this required a lot of creative segmenting of the data.
* The variables that had the stronger correlations (such as they were) with quality were also correlated with each other, which would lead to multicolinearity when modelling.

## Successes

* Finding the article that explained the 9 regions of Vinho Verde and recent improvements in wine making quality. This gave me the idea of splitting the data by alchohol level. 

* Doing a few other projects involving ggplot2, and reading Hadley's guide, which made plotting much easier than it was the first time I submitted this project (2 years ago!).
