# What is Vinho Verde?

The data set, from 2008, is comprised of white wines known as *Vinho Verde* (green wine). *Vinho Verde* (VV) refers to the Minho region of northern Portugal; it is not a type of grape. This region is known for being cooler and wetter than the rest of the country in the winter, although it does get hot in the summer.

VV wines have traditionally been known for being light, crisp and low in alchohol, and were meant to be drunk young (when they're "green"). Lately, however, VV's reputation of being a cheap & cheerful wine has begun to change.

Within this region, there are nine sub-regions.

![vvmap](images/vinhoverdemap.jpg)

As you can see from the map, the topgraphy of the VV region is varied, as well as for several of its subregions. Vinho verde wines can come from the Atlantic coast, the mountains, or inland plains. Soils vary, as do the type of grapes grown.

# Data description

   1 - fixed acidity: most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)

   2 - volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste

   3 - citric acid: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines

   4 - residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet

   5 - chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine

   6 - free sulfur dioxide: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine

   7 - total sulfur dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine

   8 - density: the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content

   9 - pH: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale

   10 - sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant

   11 - alcohol: the percent alcohol content of the wine

   Output variable (based on sensory data): 
   12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)

# Univariate Plots Section

> **Tip**: In this section, you should perform some preliminary exploration of
your dataset. Run some summaries of the data and create univariate plots to
understand the structure of the individual variables in your dataset. Don't
forget to add a comment after each plot or closely-related group of plots!
There should be multiple code chunks and text sections; the first one below is
just to help you get started.

How large is this data set?

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}

dim(whites)

```

What are the variable names?

```{r}

names(whites)

```

Let's see the underlying structure of the data.

```{r}

str(whites)

```

The data is either integer or numeric. 

Alas, none of the categorical information mentioned above, such as soil type, grape variety, or subregion, is included in this data set.

Since we need at least one categorical variable for this dataset, let's convert `quality`.

```{r, create category var}

whites$quality <-factor(whites$quality)
levels(whites$quality)

```

```{r df summary}

summary(whites)

```

There are no NA values. Only `citric.acid` has zero values. The scale of values varies from the 100s for `total.sulfur.dioxide` to 1000th decimal place for `chlorides`.

Now I'd like to look at distributions, but first need to convert the df to long format.

```{r convert_to_long}


whites.tidy <- whites %>% 
  gather(fixed.acidity, volatile.acidity, citric.acid, residual.sugar, 
         chlorides, free.sulfur.dioxide, total.sulfur.dioxide, density,
         pH, sulphates, alcohol,
         key = 'component', value = 'value', 
         na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  group_by(quality) %>% 
  arrange(quality)

whites.tidy <- data.frame(whites.tidy)
str(whites.tidy)

```

```{r view_whites_tidy}

head(whites.tidy)

```

Ok, now we're ready to plot histograms.

```{r plot_hists}

p.tidy <- ggplot(data = whites.tidy, aes(x = value))


# add geom layer
hg <- p.tidy + geom_histogram()

# assign facet wrap to a variable
# & fix ranges for x-axes
fw <- facet_wrap(~component, scales = 'free_x')
hg + fw

```

Aside from `pH`, most variables have a moderate negative skew. `residual.sugar` has a pronounced negative skew. `alcohol` has a strangely flat shape.

What will a log-transform yield?

```{r log_transform}

hg + fw + 
  scale_x_log10()

```

Log10 transform of `residual.sugar` is bimodal. Perhaps there are two distinct wine populations in the  dataset? `alcohol` still is strangely flat.

```{r boxplots}
p.tidy <- p.tidy %+% aes(group=component, y = value)

# add boxplot & facet layers
bp <- p.tidy + 
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.1)

# update fw var to free y-axis!
fw <- facet_wrap(~component, scales = 'free')

# try again
bp + fw
```
The only variable without positive outliers is `alcohol`. `chlorides` and `citric.acid` seem to have a high number of positive outliers. The `density` and `residual.sugar` outliers look similar.

Are any of the outliers occuring for the same row?

```{r max_vals}
# Do these extreme outliers belong to the same row?

colMaxIdx <- function(data) sapply(data, which.max)

whites.num <- unlist(lapply(whites, is.numeric))

max.rows <- colMaxIdx(whites[whites.num])
```

Nope!

# `quality`

Let's see how many of each quality level?

```{r quality_count}

summary((whites$quality))
qplot(quality, data=whites)


```

A normal distribution: lots of mediocre wines with few low-quality and even fewer high-quality wines. 

With so many wines with a 6 rating, it might be easier to find patterns by grouping these scores into low-medium-high groups. 

```{r group_quality}

whites <- whites %>%
  mutate(qual.grp = ifelse(as.integer(quality) < 6, 'low',
                           ifelse(as.integer(quality) <7,'medium', 'high')))

```

## `alcohol`


```{r alcohol dist, fig.show='hide'}

p = qplot(alcohol, data=whites, binwidth=.2)
p

```

```{r alcohol summary}

summary(whites$alcohol)

```

Alcohol content ranges from `r min(whites$alcohol)` to `r max(whites$alcohol)`% by volume. 
The distribution looks unusual, not just bimodal but multimodal. 
The main mode is at 9.5%, but there are smaller, 'local' modes at 10.5% and 12% as well. 

**Dip at 11.5%** 

Regardless of binwidth, there was a clear dip at 11.5%. Why?

This could be due to labelling rules:

* ‘generic’ Vinho Verde must lie between 8% and 11.5% alcohol by volume (ABV)
* wine from one of the one of the nine sub-regions, which specialise in particular grape varieties, the range extends from 9% to 14% ABV
* Vinho Verde made from the single varietal Alvarinho can be between 11.5% and 14% ABV

[Reference](https://www.alcoholprofessor.com/blog/2014/04/23/vinho-verde-a-splash-of-summer-vinous-joy/)

**Are alcohol values continuous or discrete?** 

```{r alcohol bar chart, echo=TRUE}

ggplot(aes(alcohol), data=whites) +
  geom_bar() + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(8,14.5,.5))

```


Alcohol content % is usually listed to the 10th of a percentage point. Round numbers, and .5 are more common than others.

It would be worthwhile to create some categorie variables based on alcohol content to see if quality correlations differ for different wine classifications.


```{r label_alchol_ranges}
whites <- whites %>% 
  mutate(alvarinho.range = ifelse(alcohol > 11.5, TRUE, FALSE), 
         generic.range = ifelse(alcohol <=11.5, TRUE, FALSE),
         subregion.range = ifelse(alcohol > 9, TRUE, FALSE))

```



## `fixed.acidity`

> In wine tasting, the term “acidity” refers to the fresh, tart and sour attributes of the wine which are evaluated in relation to how well the acidity balances out the sweetness and bitter components of the wine such as tannins. Three primary acids are found in wine grapes: tartaric, malic and citric acids. — http://winemaking.jackkeller.net/acid.asp

`fixed.acidity` in our data set only refers to tartaric acid, the most predominant acid in wine. It helps stabilize a wine's chemical make-up and its colour. It also contributes to taste. 

It is measured in g/dm^3, which is a more scientific notation for g/l. Multiply this value by 0.1 to calculate the % by volume.

How to intrepret fixed acidity values: 

* .4% (4g/l) is considered flat
* 1% (10g/l) FA is considered too tart to be drinkable.
* Most table wine is between 0.6 to 0.7%.

```{r fixed.acidity summary}

summary(whites$fixed.acidity)

#p = qplot(fixed.acidity, data=whites, binwidth=.3)
p = ggplot(data = whites, aes(x = fixed.acidity)) +
  geom_histogram()

p + scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(3,14,1)) 

```

`fixed.acidity` has a very slight negative skew but it is hard to see clearly on this plot. There seems to be some negative outliers too.

Let's try a boxplot instead that also shows the underlying points.

```{r fixed.acidity boxplot with points}

ggplot(aes(x="1", y=fixed.acidity), data=whites) +
  geom_boxplot(width=0.6, alpha=0.2)
  
```

Indeed, most values do fall between 6 and 7.5 g/l. But there is a cluster of low, 'flat-tasting' wines between 4 & 5, and a bigger cluster at the tart end of the scale, between 8.5 & 9.



##`volatile.acidity`

Volatile acidity (VA) is primarily a measure of the presence of acetic acid. While a small amount is a natural by-product of fermentation, exposure to oxygen converts alcohol to acetic acid, which is known as oxidization. Too much acetic acid creates a vinegar taste in wine. 

A VA of 0.03-0.06% is produced during fermentation and is considered a normal level. 
(source: http://www.wineperspective.com/the_acidity_of_wine.htm)

Since `volatile.acidity` is in g/l, multiply the values by 0.1 to calculate the %.

```{r volatile.acidity summary}

summary(whites$volatile.acidity)

qplot(volatile.acidity, data=whites,
      binwidth=.02)

```

The distribution is negatively skewed. Let's transform the x-axis to have a better look at the long tail values.

```{r volatile.acidity log10}

qplot(volatile.acidity, data=whites, 
      binwidth=.05) + 
      scale_x_log10(breaks=seq(0,1,.1))

```

While most of values are less than 0.03%, there are quite a few outliers above 0.06%, with the highest reaching `r max(whites$volatile.acidity) * 0.1`%.

```{r}
ggplot(whites, aes(x=1, y=volatile.acidity)) + 
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.2)
```


##`citric.acid`


```{r citric.acid summary}

summary(whites$citric.acid)

qplot(citric.acid, data=whites, 
      binwidth=.02)

```

The distribution for `citric acid` is normal with fewer positive outliers compared to the previous phytochemicals examined.

After reducing the binwidth I noticed some strange spikes at 0, 0.5 and 0.75g/l, and even at 1g/l.

Here is a possible explanation: 

> In the European Union, use of citric acid for acidification is prohibited, but limited use of citric acid is permitted for removing excess iron and copper from the wine if potassium ferrocyanide is not available. — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acids_in_wine#Citric_acid

And this is from a 2003 export agreement between Canada and the EU:

> 15. addition of citric acid for wine stabilisation purposes, provided that the final content in the treated wine does not exceed 1 g/l, — http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52003PC0377 (section B, item 15)

## `sulphates`

Sulphates stabilize wine, and are more important for white wines than reds, which also have tannins to help with stabilization.

Maximum levels of sulfur dioxide that a wine can contain 210 mg/l for white wine, 260 mg/l for sweet wines (> 5g/l residual sugar). [source](http://adlib.everysite.co.uk/resources/000/264/146/euwineregs.pdf)

```{r}

qplot(sulphates, data=whites, binwidth = 0.025)

```

This also looks to be bi-modal and negatively skewed, with modes around 0.4 and 0.5. 

```{r}

summary(whites$sulphates)

```


##`pH`

This is a test of how strong the acidity is. Wines typically have a pH between 2.9 and 3.9.
The lower the pH, the more acidic (instead of basic) the wine.

```{r pH summary}

summary(whites$pH)

#pH:Perfectly normal!
qplot(pH, data=whites, binwidth=.05) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(2,4.5,.25)) 

```

In this dataset `pH`'s distribution is a near-perfect bell curve. 

The entire range of `pH` values is from `r min(whites$pH)` to `r max(whites$pH)`, so veers slightly more than usual to the acidic end of the wine pH spectrum.

##`chlorides`

> In most wines, the chloride concentration is below 50mg/l, expressed in sodium chloride. It may exceed 1g/l in wine made from grapes grown by the sea.

> Sodium chloride is sometimes added during fining, especially when egg whites are used.- [Handbook of Enology, The Chemistry of Wine: Stabilization and Treatments](https://books.google.fr/books?id=a03C-aFy2jsC&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=adding+sodium+chloride+to+wine&source=bl&ots=pAoGDmfuTl&sig=AqMfDCikyNKXX__SWzFgWuvam5o&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjfy4rx9KHLAhUGcHIKHZxSATcQ6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&q=adding%20sodium%20chloride%20to%20wine&f=false)


```{r chlorides hist}

qplot(chlorides, data=whites, binwidth=.005)

```

Negatively skewed with a particularly long tail. 

```{r chlorides_summary}

summary(whites$chlorides)

```


```{r chloride log10}

#look at that long tail
qplot(chlorides, data=whites, binwidth=.05) +
  scale_x_log10()

```

This looks more balanced. Let's confirm with a boxplot.

```{r chlorides boxplot}

ggplot(aes(x="1", y=chlorides), data=whites) +
  geom_boxplot(width=0.5, alpha=0.2) + 
  scale_y_log10()

```

Transforming the x-axis to log10 shows that choloride values are discrete that beome continuous as chloride levels reach 0.3 g/l (300 mg/l) and a bit beyond. This is higher than normal, but still a far cry from 1 g/l.

I wonder if the region's notorious rain and mist in wintertime results in higher than usual salinity in the soil of coastal subregions, which is then absorbed by the grapes. 

```{r log_xform_chlorides}

whites <- whites %>% 
  mutate(log10.chlorides = log10(chlorides))

  
```

##`residual.sugar`


```{r residual.sugar_hist}

qplot(residual.sugar, data=whites, binwidth=1) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,25), breaks=seq(0,25,5))

```

```{r residual.sugar_summary}

summary(whites$residual.sugar)

```

This distribution looks like a swan, where the dramatic mode around 2 is the neck and then a lumpy tail as its body.

Let's look at this using a log10 x-axis.

```{r residual.sugar log10 plots}

ggplot(aes(x=log(residual.sugar + 1), y=..density..), data=whites) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth=.1) +
  geom_density(color='blue')
  

```

There are a few extreme outliers above 20. The distribution now looks like a camel: it has two humps. 

Are there two populations within this data set?

```{r residual.sugar_violin_plot}

ggplot(aes(x=1, y=log10(residual.sugar)), data=whites) +
  geom_violin(color='blue') + 
  geom_jitter(alpha=0.2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.5, color='blue')
```

Perhaps there is, so I'd like two new variables, one a log10 transform of residual.sugar, and the other a categorical variable for sweetness.

```{r create_new_vars_residual.sugar}

whites <- whites %>% 
  mutate(log10.rs = log10(residual.sugar),
         rs.level = ifelse(log10.rs > .5, 'high', 'low'))

```



```{r}

str(whites$rs.level)

```

## Density

Density is what makes wine feel full-bodied. Since VV wines are known for their lightness, I'd expect this dataset to be lower-density than your typical white wine dataset (if I had any to compare it to).

Higher density in wine is usually a result of higher sugar or higher alcohol content. 

```{r density_hist}

summary(whites$density)

#D: similar to sugar, extreme pos outlier
qplot(density, data=whites, binwidth=.0005) 


```

```{r density_boxplot}

ggplot(aes(x="1", y=density), data=whites) +
  geom_boxplot(width=0.5, alpha=0.2)

```

There are only 2 extreme outliers in that long tail. What does the distribution look like if we zoom in?

```{r density_zoom_hist}

qplot(density, data=whites, binwidth=.0005) + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0.985,1.005))

```


Not suprisingly, since it's related to sugar & alcohol, `density`'s distribution is a bit lumpy, but less than for `residual.sugar` and `alcohol`. It also has two extreme positive outliers, just like `residual.sugar`.

```{r}

qplot(density, data=whites, binwidth=.0002) + 
  scale_x_log10(limits=c(0.985,1.005)) +
  geom_density(colour='blue')

```

This doesn't help much.


# Univariate analysis

##What is the structure of your dataset?

There are `r nrow(whites)` rows, and `r dim(whites)[2]` variables.
All variables are numeric. In order to have at least one categorical variable, I converted `quality` to a factor with 7 levels.

Most wine is of average quality, a 5 or a 6. The mean `quality` score is `r mean(as.integer(whites$quality)) + 2`.

`alcohol`ranges from `r min(whites$alcohol)` to `r max(whites$alcohol)`%. The most common alcohol content is 9.5%, but the median is `r median(whites$alcohol)`, very close to the mean is `r mean(whites$alcohol)`.

Wine with a residual sugar content greater than 45 is considered sweet. Only one wine in the dataset would therefore be considered sweet. It had the maximum value of `r max(whites$residual.sugar)`g. Most wines are far below this. Average `residual.sugar` content is `r mean(whites$residual.sugar)`g, while the median is a considerably lower `r median(whites$residual.sugar)`g.


##What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?

The features I'm most interested are the characteristics most easily perceived by judges:

* alcohol
* residual.sugar
* density (mouthfeel)

The main feature I'm interested in are `alcohol`. The VV wine's alcohol content determines how specific a region can be used on its label. Generally, the more narrower the region, the higher the price.

The main question I have around alcohol is whether quality correlates to specificity of region? In other words, do generic Vinho Verde tend to score lower than the higher subsets of wine?

The other key feature is `residual.sugar`. It plays a major part in flavour and density. Lower values could indicate secondary fermentation, which could either mean a wine that is pleasantly fizzy, or one that is more round and buttery instead of sharper and acidic. 


##What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?

These features:

* citric.acid (freshness)
* pH (acidity)
* chlorides, because numerous articles about the wine referred to a refreshingly salty-sweet taste.

Also, the features described in the section below will help identify different subsets for which quality correlates differently.

##Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?

Yes, I created categorical variables to: 

* group quality into low-med-high buckets
* label wines by alcohol range
* label wines by sweetness

I also transformed `residual.sugar` and `chlorides` into log10 values.

```{r new_features}

whites.new = names(whites)[c(-1:-13)]
whites.new

```


##Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?

Yes: 

* `residual.sugar` and `chlorides` both had very long positive tails, so I created log10 transformations for them.
* `alcohol` distribution was multi-modal that corresponded to wine labelling limits, so I created the categorical variables listed in the section above. 
* the log of `residual.sugar` is bi-modal so I created the `rs.level` categorical variable.

# Bivariate Plots Section

> **Tip**: Based on what you saw in the univariate plots, what relationships
between variables might be interesting to look at in this section? Don't limit
yourself to relationships between a main output feature and one of the
supporting variables. Try to look at relationships between supporting variables
as well.

```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots}

```

What are the correlations? 

```{r}

whites.cor <- whites %>%
  select(-X) %>% 
  mutate(quality = as.integer(quality)) %>%
  select_if(is.numeric) %>% 
  cor()

round(whites.cor, 2)

```


```{r prep for ggpairs, echo=TRUE}

# whites

whites.subset <- subset(whites,select=-X) #improve readability
#whites.subset$quality <- as.numeric(whites.subset$quality) #to get correlation

# create sample so it's faster to run
set.seed(888)
whites.samp <- whites.subset[sample(1:nrow(whites.subset), 1000), ]


```



```{r ggpairs}

ggpairs(data = whites.samp,
        columns =2:12,
        axisLabels = 'show',
        lower = list(continuous = wrap("smooth", alpha=0.2, shape = I('.'), alpha = 0.1)), 
        upper = list(combo = wrap("box", outlier.shape = I('.'))))



```

## `quality` counts by...

### `residual.sugar` level

```{r}

table(whites$rs.level)

```



```{r}

d = ggplot(aes(quality), data =whites)

d + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill=quality)) +
  facet_wrap(~rs.level)

```

There seem to be a higher proportion of high-scoring wines in the low-residual.sugar group.


```{r}

with(whites, by(quality, rs.level, summary))

```


### `alcohol` level

```{r}

table(whites$alvarinho.range)

```


```{r}

d + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill=quality)) +
  facet_wrap(~alvarinho.range)

```

```{r}

d + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill=quality)) +
  facet_grid(rs.level~alvarinho.range)

```

So how I read this:

* higher alcohol == greater % of high-scoring wines
* Within higher alcohol group, wines with high residual.sugar have bigger proportion of high-scores.
* For lower alcohol group, it's the reverse!


```{r}

whites %>% 
  group_by(rs.level, alvarinho.range, quality) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(pct = round((n / sum(n) * 100), digits = 2))


```


## `quality` vs...

### `alcohol`

```{r alcohol_vs_quality}

d <- ggplot(aes(alcohol, fill=quality), data=whites)
dnsty <- geom_density(alpha=0.2)

d + dnsty

```

It looks lower alcohol wines have a much greater tendency to lower quality. The highest quality generic (low-alcohol) wines are near the upper end of the alcohol limit for generic vinho verde.

Also, higher-quality (>=7) wines have distinctly multi-modal distributions (bimodal for level 9). Low-quality wines don't have a clear mode, but do have long tails. 


### `log10.rs` 

```{r}

d %+% aes(x = log10.rs) + dnsty

```

It isn't as clear-cut as for alcohol. 

Here we see bimodal distribtuions at all quality levels. Level 8 seems to have 3 in fact.

In general,the highest proportion of high quality wines reside at the lower-end of `log10.rs`.


### `log10.chlorides`

```{r quality_vs_log10.chlorides}

d %+% aes(x=log10.chlorides) + 
  dnsty

```


```{r}

violin <- geom_violin(alpha = 0.2, draw_quantiles = .5)
jitter <- geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1)

d %+% aes(x=quality, y=log10.chlorides) +
  violin + jitter
```

From quality level 5 (maybe 4 too), `log10.chlorides` has a negative correlation with quality that grows stronger for top-end wines.

```{r}

with(whites, by(log10.chlorides, quality, median))

```


### `total.sulfur.dioxide`

```{r}

d %+% aes(total.sulfur.dioxide) + 
  dnsty

```

```{r}

d %+% aes(quality, total.sulfur.dioxide) + violin + jitter
                 
```

Generally there's a negative correlation with `quality`, but level 4 bucks the trend. But this relationship seems weaker for higher quality wines.

Let's confirm by comparing medians.

```{r compare_summary_total.sulfur.dioxide}

with(whites, by(total.sulfur.dioxide,quality, median))

```

### `volatile.acidity`

```{r}


d <- ggplot(aes(volatile.acidity, fill=quality), data = whites)
d + dnsty

```



```{r}

d <- d %+% aes(log10(volatile.acidity))
d + dnsty

```

Not much more illuminating.

```{r}

d <- d %+% aes(x=quality, y=log10(volatile.acidity), fill=quality)

d + violin + jitter +
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(.985, 1.01))

```

No clear relationship with `quality`!

## `alcohol` vs..

### `log10.rs`

```{r alcohol_log10.rs}

d <- ggplot(aes(alcohol, log10.rs), data = whites)

d + geom_point(alpha = 0.2)

```

There are two clusters: 

* a higher-rs group that has a clear negative correlation between sugar & alcohol
* a lower-rs group for which the correlation is less apparent. 

Let's add some trend lines to these two clusters.

```{r show_converging_trends}

ss.rs = stat_smooth(aes(color = rs.level), method = 'lm')
d + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) + 
  ss.rs

```


There's an inverse relationship between residual.sugar and alcohol.

At the lowest alcohol levels there is a much greater proportion of high residual.sugar wines.
Beyond 10% alcohol, low residual.sugar wines become the majority, although not to the same extent.

Here's another way to represent it.

```{r}

d <- ggplot(aes(alcohol, fill=rs.level), data = whites)

d + dnsty

```

### `density`

```{r}

d <- ggplot(aes(alcohol, density), data = whites)

d + geom_hex()

```

### `log10.chlorides`

```{r}

d <- ggplot(aes(alcohol, log10.chlorides), data = whites)

d + geom_hex()

```

This relationship by contrast looks linear for the entire dataset.

Let's confirm.

```{r single trendline}

d + geom_hex() + 
  stat_smooth(method = 'lm')

```


```{r trendline by rs.level}

d + geom_hex() + 
  ss.rs

```


### `total.sulfur.dioxide`

```{r}

d <- d %+% aes(alcohol, total.sulfur.dioxide) 
d + geom_hex()

```

Here I think we're back to clusters, especially when I look back at the quality distributions for `total.sulfur.dioxide`.

```{r}

d + geom_hex() + ss.rs

```

### `volatile.acidity`

```{r}

d <- d %+% aes(y = volatile.acidity)
d + geom_hex() + ss.rs

```


## `log10.rs` vs..

### `log10.chlorides`

```{r residual.sugar_vs_log10.chlorides}

d <- d %+% aes(x = log10.rs, y = log10.chlorides)

d + geom_hex()

```

Definitely clustered.

```{r}

d + geom_hex() + ss.rs

```

### `total.sulfur.dioxide`

```{r log10.rs_vs_`total.sulfur.dioxide`}

d <- d %+% aes(y = total.sulfur.dioxide) 
d + geom_hex()

```

### `volatile.acidity`


```{r}

d <- d %+% aes(y = volatile.acidity)
d + geom_hex() + ss.rs

```



## `log10.chlorides` vs...

### `total.sulfur.dioxide`

```{r log10.chlorides_vs_total.sulfur.dioxide}

d <-  d %+% aes(log10.chlorides, total.sulfur.dioxide)

d + geom_hex() + ss.rs


```

This just reinforces what we saw earlier. Both of these variables have negative correlations with `alcohol` and `quality`, so it's not surprising they have a positive relationship with each other.

### `volatile.acidity`

```{r}

d <-  d %+% aes(y = volatile.acidity)

d + geom_hex() + ss.rs

```

There's a slight positive correlation, but there's also a lot of noise.


## `total.sulfur.dioxide` vs 

### `volatile.acidity`

```{r}

d <-  ggplot(aes(total.sulfur.dioxide, volatile.acidity), data = whites)

d + geom_hex() 
#+ ss.rs

```

# Bivariate Analysis


### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the \
investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in \
the dataset?

* Quality tends to increase with alcohol, but decrease with chlorides and total.sulfur.dioxide

* At all alcohol levels, there seems to be two subsets, a lower residual.sugar group (log10.rs < 0.5) and a higher one:

  * There is far more high-rs wines at lower alcohol levels (alcohol < 10%).
  * The lower rs group has a slight negative correlation with alcohol. 
  * On the other hand, the higher rs group has a barely perceptible positive correlation.

* chlorides and log10.rs also have diverging trendlines for high & low rs groups:
  * high rs wines gently increase in chlorides as alcohol increases
  * low rs wines show a slight decrease in chlorides as alcohol increases

* volatile.acidity also has a slightly divergent trendline with log10.rs, in that the low-rs group has a

# Multivariate Plots Section

> **Tip**: Now it's time to put everything together. Based on what you found in
the bivariate plots section, create a few multivariate plots to investigate
more complex interactions between variables. Make sure that the plots that you
create here are justified by the plots you explored in the previous section. If
you plan on creating any mathematical models, this is the section where you
will do that.



```{r}


whites %>% 
  group_by(rs.level) %>% 
  count()
```

```{r}


whites %>% 
  group_by(rs.level, qual.grp) %>% 
  count()
```


```{r echo=FALSE, Multivariate_Plots}

d = ggplot(aes(alcohol, log10.rs), data =whites)
d + 
  geom_point(aes(colour=quality), alpha = 0.5) + 
  stat_smooth(aes(colour=quality), method = 'lm', se=FALSE) +
  facet_grid(rs.level ~ alvarinho.range, scales = 'free')
```

In most cases, the better wines have less sugar as alcohol increases. 
The exception: low-residual sugar, high-alcohol wines (bottom right panel, above).

```{r}

d <- d %+% aes(x = alcohol, y = log10.rs)

d + 
  geom_point(aes(colour=quality), alpha = 0.5) + 
  facet_grid(quality ~ rs.level, scales = 'free')


```

## total.sulfur.dioxide by log10.chlorides

```{r}

d = ggplot(aes(total.sulfur.dioxide, log10.chlorides), data =whites)
d + 
  geom_point(aes(colour=quality), alpha = 0.5) + 
  facet_wrap(~quality, ncol = 1, scales='free_y')

```

Interesting: as quality improves, the _range_ for `total.sulfur.dioxide` & `log10.chlorides` becomes much narrower.

Does this hold true when we facet this by sugar?

```{r facet_by_residual.sugar}

d = ggplot(aes(total.sulfur.dioxide, log10.chlorides), data =whites)
d + 
  geom_point(aes(colour=quality), alpha = 0.5) + 
  facet_grid(quality ~ rs.level, scales='free_y')

```

Yes, particularly for low residual sugar wines.

Let's facet by alcohol now.

```{r facet_by_alchol_range}

d +
  geom_point( aes(colour=quality), alpha = 0.5) + 
  facet_grid(quality ~ alvarinho.range, scales = 'free_y')


```

Yes for the low-alcohol wines (FALSE column): for each step up the `quality` ladded, the minimum `total.sulfur.dioxide` increases & while the maximum decreases.

For high-alcohol wines, the notion of an 'ideal range' of `total.sulfur.dioxide` in top-quality wines still holds true, but not as clearly-defined.

The 'ideal range' for `log10.chlorides` is more difficult to see here.

```{r}

d <- ggplot(aes(quality, log10.chlorides), data = whites)

d + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = quality), alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~rs.level)

```

In both cases, the best wines have fewer chlorides, but not necessarily the least.

Let's break this down further.

```{r}

d %+% aes(quality, log10.chlorides) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = quality), alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_grid(alvarinho.range~rs.level)
```


This is a cleaner way to see it.

```{r}

d %+% aes(quality, total.sulfur.dioxide) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = quality), alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_grid(alvarinho.range~rs.level)

```

There's a relationship between `quality` & `total.sulfur.dioxide` for high-residual sugar wines. 

The _direction_ of the relationship, however, depends on whether the wine is high- or low-alcohol.

## density vs alcohol

```{r}

d <- ggplot(aes(alcohol, density), data = whites)

d + 
  geom_point(aes(color = quality), alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_grid(alvarinho.range~rs.level)

```

## total.sulfur.dioxide & volatile.acidity

```{r}

d %+% aes(volatile.acidity, total.sulfur.dioxide) +
  geom_point(aes(color = quality), alpha = 0.5) + 
  facet_grid(quality~rs.level, scales='free_y')

```


```{r}

d %+% aes(quality, volatile.acidity) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = quality), alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_grid(alvarinho.range~rs.level)

```

If we measure distance from median quality 9, how well will it correlate with quality?

```{r}
with(whites, by(total.sulfur.dioxide, quality, summary))
```


```{r}

df = filter(whites, quality == 9)
ideal.CI <- median(df$log10.chlorides)
ideal.SO2 <- median(df$total.sulfur.dioxide)
```


```{r}

whites <- whites %>% 
  mutate(so2.ideal.dist = abs(total.sulfur.dioxide - ideal.SO2),
         ci.ideal.dist = abs(log10.chlorides - ideal.CI))

```




```{r}

whites %>% 
  #filter(rs.level == 'low') %>% 
  ggplot(aes(density, alcohol)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.5, aes(color = quality)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se=FALSE) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(.985, 1.005)) +
  facet_grid(~quality, scale = 'free_y')
  
  
```


```{r}

d %+% aes(x=alcohol, y = density  ) +
  geom_point(aes(colour=quality), alpha = 0.5) + 
  facet_grid(quality ~ rs.level, scales = 'free_y')



```
